## Business Problem
Keystone Strategy's recruiting team often receives large "resume books"  containing Â hundreds of resumes from universities and their student organizations, which they then have to manually parse to catalog attributes about applicants such as education, work experience, skills, etc, before doing a more detailed review for fit with the organization. Keystone would like to automate this process using machine learning. A machine learning-based resume parsing will save recruiting team from hours of daily work by eliminating manual processing and analysis for every resume they receive.
