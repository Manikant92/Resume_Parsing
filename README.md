## Business Problem
Keystone Strategy's recruiting team often receives large "resume books"  containing Â hundreds of resumes from universities and their student organizations, which they then have to manually parse to catalog attributes about applicants such as education, work experience, skills, etc, before doing a more detailed review for fit with the organization. Keystone would like to automate this process using machine learning. A machine learning-based resume parsing will save recruiting team from hours of daily work by eliminating manual processing and analysis for every resume they receive. 

## Data
Our custom dataset consists of resumes from three resume books from graduate business schools such as Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, Haas School of Business at Berekely, and Standard Graduate School of Business. In total, there are 841 resumes of MBA candidates.

## Conclusion
Selecting the right candidates from a pool of applicants can be one of the toughest jobs for the talent acquisition leaders. Moreover, going through each resume manually for every hiring season can be tiresome and time consuming. The machine learning resume parser tool can be a life saver for the entire company. It can provide unbiased solutions while overcoming possible manual errors.
